Please ensure you have the Frappe 'bench' cli tool installed:

#### Development Notes

Frappe framework utlizes the bench CLI as a development, deployment, and devops tool. You may have multiple benches to for development and/or production testing. Our production server will likely have a product bench with versioning configuration files.

##### Fresh Installation
If instantiating a fresh installation of a bench, perform the following commands::

```
$ bench init name-of-your-bench ; cd name-of-your-bench
$ bench get-app https://github.com/process-success/Process-Success-Application.git
$ cd apps/process-success
$ git checkout develop
```
PLEASE MAKE SURE TO SWITCH TO DEVELOP/FEATURE BRANCH AS PULLING AN APP FROM GIT USING BENCH WILL PLACE YOU IN MASTER!!

##### Normal Development
Once installed, you can use bench normally with our new app. You may create sites, install the app, etc,. To manage changes, make sure you are in your appropriate feature branch, and simply enter the working directory of your feature branch and run git commands as you normally would.

Example:
```
$ bench cd apps/process-success
$ git status
$ git add . ; git commit
$ git push origin <branch name>
```
